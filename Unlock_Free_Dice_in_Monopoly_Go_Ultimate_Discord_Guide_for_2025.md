Another popular method for acquiring free dice is through dice generators. These generators are websites or applications that claim to offer unlimited dice for the game.

Dice generators typically work by exploiting vulnerabilities in the game's code. They send requests to the game's servers and simulate the action of earning dice. It’s important to only use trusted generators, as some can lead to account bans or other issues.
